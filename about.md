I am a Computer Science and Data Science student at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison and will graduate in December 2025. My work and internships have centered on software engineering, application security, and full stack development. At Nelnet I created automated health alerts that improved outage response times, contributed features to an internal gamification platform, and gave a company-wide security presentation. I have also built projects that range from a Java-based GPS navigation tool to an arcade style game with persistent state management.

I like solving problems that connect systems, data, and security. My technical skills include Python, Java, C++, React, Angular, .NET, and SQL along with experience in cloud platforms and developer tools. Outside of classes and internships I work on projects that help me learn new frameworks and explore areas such as distributed systems and machine learning.

My goal is to begin my career as a software engineer where I can contribute to production systems, grow my technical skills, and be part of teams that value engineering quality and practical problem solving. Connect with me on LinkedIn and/or email me if you want to do some partner programming or just grab some coffee!
